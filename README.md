# CplusplusProject
**Summarize the project and what problem it was solving**
The project was to create an app that would track and compare investments over time. Comparing accounts with and without a monthly deposit. 

**What did you do particularly well**
I feel like I set up the constructors well and made the menu look nice

**Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?**
 Well, I could've actually finished the program. I could further enhance it by including more comments/notes to help make sense of it all. 

 **Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network**
 I found myself overthinking when it came to calculating the interest and ending balance. To overcome this, I had to take a step away and write down the math on paper. 

 **What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?**
 Handline multiple files that will work together.

 **How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**
 Putting enough spacing between code and adding comments.
